Me & my sister weren’t offered any drinks or anything ! I won’t be coming back here I don’t feel welcomed at all I’m not sure if it’s a race issue with black people, but what they fail to realize is most of their  clientele comes from black people so I will gladly take my BLACK dollars somewhere else and spend it where it makes sense🤏🏽  zero out of 10 would not recommend",

      "original_text": "I was super excited for a new nail spot on west end of Belleville.  I have gone to mi nails O'Fallon location in the past but didn't have the greatest experience but I got nails done then.\n\nToday I called earlier to book for a spa pedi with anyone.  Not realizing Yenni is one highly recommended, but she only does nails not toes.  I had Anna (sp) who was kind and gentle. She took her time and listened.\n\nThe gentleman at the front is very nice and accommodating. He made sure I had a book to look at color options.   They have 9 pedi chairs and 9 nail tables. About 7 big screen tvs to view while being pampered.\nPrices for the pedicures are about avg/reasonable.\n\nThey were running a sale until\nFeb 2? About 40% off pedicures and there's more too. The spa is super clean and they did a nice job on the interior! I will definitely be back!! Great job mi nail!!",
